      <h2>About the Playwright</h2>
      <p><strong>Samuel Barclay Beckett</strong> (13 April 1906 - 22 December 1989) was an Irish avant-garde novelist, playwright, theatre director, and poet, who lived in Paris for most of his adult life and wrote in both English and French. He is widely regarded as among the most influential writers of the 20th century.</p>

      <p>Beckett's work offers a bleak, tragicomic outlook on human existence, often coupled with black comedy and gallows humour, and became increasingly minimalist in his later career. He is considered one of the last modernist writers, and one of the key figures in what Martin Esslin called the <em>Theatre of the Absurd</em>.</p>

      <p>Beckett was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Literature "for his writing, which-in new forms for the novel and drama-in the destitution of modern man acquires its elevation." He was elected Saoi of Aosdana in 1984. Learn more about Samuel Beckett <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett">here</a>.</p>
